Each presenter should submit an extended abstract of no longer than two 8.5Ã—11 inch pages in PDF via the submission web page, easychair (<https://easychair.org/cfp/aplas2017poster>) by 15 September. The submission should include the title and the complete list of author(s) and affiliation(s). Your abstract should contain a brief description of your problem, the key contributions of your work, how your work compares to prior research, and any results from evaluation. 

You can use ACM template to format your submission, and the ACM template link is here: <https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>.

We will announce the accepted presentations on 22 September. We hope to accommodate every presentation, but may restrict them (based on relevance and interest to the community) due to space constraints.
