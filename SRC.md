# Student Research Competition

## Overview
This year APLAS will host a Student Research Competition where students 
can present posters. The Competition consists of three rounds:

1) Extended abstract round: Participants submit an extended abstract 
outlining their research results. Please follow the submission 
requirements of [posters](posters.html).

2) Poster session at APLAS 2017: Based on the abstracts, a panel of 
judges will select the most promising entrants to participate in the 
poster session at APLAS. In the poster session, students will have the 
opportunity to present their work to the judges, who will select three 
finalists to advance to the next round.

3) APLAS presentation: The last round will consist of a short oral 
presentation at APLAS to compete for the final award.

Note: 
1) The student research competition is NOT a part of ACM SRC.
2) The student participant must be the first author or the only author
of the submission.

The top three winners will receive prizes of $500, $200, and $200, respectively, in addition to the certificates.
