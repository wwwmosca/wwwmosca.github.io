You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown:
[Inline HTML](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#html). 

The website uses
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
as a static site generator with
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
All Markdown files will be tranlated to HTML files automatically.
